I am born and raised in southern California. I grew up in Ventura County where I was lucky enough to have the Santa Monica Mountains as my front yard, and the Los Padres National Forest as my backyard. Once I started exploring public lands, I fell in love with California's biodiversity. I realized that I wanted to be a field biologist in order to be apart of the conservation of California's diverse habitats. I eventually graduated from UC Davis with a degree in biology and began my career as a botanist and ecologist. 

I worked for many organizations after graduating including the National Park Service, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, the US Forest Service, and the Santa Clara River Conservancy. I learned something valuable from each position but realized it was time for me to go back to school. I am now a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Managament. I am learning more about management and policy so that I could be involved with the planning and implementation of restoration projects instead of just the field-work. 

I love all things native plants! I am a California Native Plant Society (CNPS) student advisor and get out to botanize any chance I get (though not as much since starting graduate school). My husband and I can often be found hiking in the Los Padres National Forest or camping out at Carrizo Plain National Monument. One of my guilty pleasures includes getting take-out and re-watching Friends episodes with my cat, Mila.
