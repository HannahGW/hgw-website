      "contents": "\nI am born and raised in southern California. I grew up in Ventura County where I was lucky enough to have the Santa Monica Mountains as my front yard, and the Los Padres National Forest as my backyard. However, I wasn’t truly passionate about conservation until I was a young adult. Once I started exploring public lands, I fell in love with California’s biodiversity. I realized that I wanted to be a field biologist in order to be apart of the conservation of California’s diverse habitats. I eventually graduated from UC Davis with a degree in biology and began my career as a botanist and ecologist.\nI worked for many organizations after graduating including the National Park Service, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, the US Forest Service, and the Santa Clara River Conservancy. I learned something valuable from each position but realized it was time for me to go back to school. I am know a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Managament. I wanted to learn more about management and policy so that I could be involved with the planning and implementation of restoration projects instead of just the field-work.\nI love all things native plants! I am a California Native Plant Society (CNPS) student advisor and get out to botanize any chance I get (though not as much since starting graduate school). My husband and I can often be found hiking in the Los Padres National Forest or camping out at Carrizo Plain National Monument. My guilty-pleasure includes getting take-out and re-watching Friends episodes with my cat, Mila.\nA photo of me on a tour of Tejon Ranch with CNPS (April 2017)\n\n\n",
